# Traffic-Lights

Traffic Lights is a simulated traffic lights system.
Two traffic lights, one for vehicles and one for
pedestrians, are illustrated with LEDs. There are two
buttons used in this program. When either is pressed,
the "change lights" sequence begins, stopping vehicles
and allowing pedestrians to cross the road.
   
When the changing lights sequence is nearing its end,
the green light of the pedestrian traffic light blinks
as well a short beep sound is played to warn pedestrians
the time is nearly over for crossing.
   
When it is dark, the traffic lights system is inactive.
This is illustrated by the yellow light on the vehicle
traffic light blinking. Darkness is measured with a
photoresistor that has to be calibrated upon start.
